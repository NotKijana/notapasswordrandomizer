# Not A Password Generator

This project is a simple password generator where you can input a password and it randomizes it for you. There are three outputs for a user to choose as well.

This was done as a challenge for Local Hack Day Build but will be further developed.

## Upcoming Updates
Will be adding the following in the future.

1. Password requirements that will be shown at start of input focus and when errors occur
2. Text that will pop up once the passwords are copied
3. A UI Update
4. Do's and don't popup

## How to use

1. Insert any alphanumeric characters along with the usual special characters into the input.
2. Passwords must be 8-14 characters long with no spaces (I am trying to help you out)
3. Hit submit
4. If you followed the instructions above then click any of the outputs and they will be copied to your clipboard.
5. If you do not like any of the outputs restart from the first instruction.

## Note Not from me
I hope you have a great day, week, and year! I also hope that you are able to accomplish all your goals in the future! If anyone can do it it is you!

Best,

P.S. Any input on this project would be greatly appreciated!
